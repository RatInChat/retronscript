# retronbv
### An interpreter for  retronscript
#### made by ratinchat

**Installing retroncript cli**

```sh
$ npm i ratinchat/retronscript -g
```

**Running a RV file**
```
$ retronbv script.rv
This was written in retronbv script!
```

Now the script.rv in the files above does not work. It's just there for show. Figure it out yourself.
